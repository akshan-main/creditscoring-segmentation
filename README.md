Here we evaluated the credit scores using FICO formula:<br>
A FICO® score is a particular brand of credit score. A credit score is a number that is used to predict how likely you are to pay back a loan on time.<br>
35% weight for “Payment History”, <br>
30% weight for “Credit Utilization Ratio”, <br>
15% weight for “Number of Credit Accounts”, <br>
10% weight for “Education Level”, <br>
and 10% weight for “Employment Status”. <br>
